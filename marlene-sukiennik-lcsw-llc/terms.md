Welcome to my counseling practice.  I am committed to getting you whatever your outcome is for our time together.  A counseling situation offers a unique relationship between the two of us.  In order that we start our relationship in a healthy way, I have put together this document to ensure that there are no misunderstandings about the various aspects of the counseling and psychotherapy services.

####PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND AND POPULATIONS SERVED####

I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in an independent private counseling practice.  My credentials include a Masters degree in Social Work and the Georgia Composite Board for Clinical Social Workers licenses me.  Additionally, the Nebraska Board of Behavioral Health Examiners licenses me in the state of Nebraska and the Arizona Board of Behavioral Health Examiners licenses me in the state of Arizona.  

I offer face-to-face counseling to individuals, couples and families.  I provide services to people ranging in age from 13-100.  I have been providing counseling services since 1982.  I developed a specialty in the treatment of eating disorders in 1992, but I also treat several other mental health issues including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, self-esteem/self-worth struggles, relationship difficulties/building, gay/lesbian issues, parenting issues (adolescent and adult children) and issues pertaining to the geriatric population including the geriatric patient as well as the caretaker.

I reserve the right to refer a client to another therapist or appropriate resource at any time if their needs or desires in therapy are not a good match for my skills or experience.

####DISTANCE COUNSELING SERVICES####

In addition to face-to-face counseling, I offer online video counseling and phone counseling to save time and enhance your counseling experience. Because I am licensed in the states of Arizona, Georgia and Nebraska I am able to provide distance counseling to persons living in those states. For many people, it can be difficult to schedule an in-person counseling session. Busy schedules, frequent travel, rural residence, military duty, long-distance relationships, childcare issues, anxiety, physical limitations or limited transportation are a few of the many possible barriers to seeking help. I offer online or telephone sessions to make counseling more accessible for my patients. Research has shown distance counseling, whether online video or telephone, can be just as effective as face-to-face counseling. If your counseling need is appropriate for distance counseling, you can either solely receive counseling via one medium, or any combination of them.

Here are some of the necessary requirements for online video sessions: 

1. Smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer
2. Internet connection 
3. A webcam (if your devise does not have one built-in)
4. A microphone (if your devise does not have one built-in)
5. Privacy

Video conferencing counseling sessions will be provided via the eVisit app, a secure HIPAA compliant platform. You will be required to set up an account with eVisit before our first video session. You will need to be available to log on 10 minutes prior to our scheduled time.

####LIMITATIONS OF DISTANCE COUNSELING####

Distance counseling is an alternative form of counseling with certain limitations. Whenever there is communication that lacks complete visual or audio cues, there is a risk of misunderstanding. When this happens, it is important to assume that I have positive regard for you and to check out your assumptions with me. This will reduce any unnecessary hardship. There may be disruptions in the service and quality of the technology used. If this occurs, please be patient and I will attempt to reconnect with you by phone so we can complete the session. If technology completely fails, I will reschedule with you at the earliest convenience. It is imperative to understand that distance counseling is not appropriate if you are having a crisis, acute psychosis or suicidal or homicidal thoughts.

####EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOR IN PERSON AND DISTANCE COUNSELING####

In the case of an emergency and for your safety, the following information is important and necessary. Additionally, by signing this agreement form you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the following:

1. You will inform me of the location in which you will consistently be during our distance counseling sessions. You will inform me if this location changes.

2. You will identify on your patient information form a person I may contact if I believe you are at risk. You will verify that this emergency contact person is able and willing to go to your location in the event of an emergency or if I deem necessary, call 911 and/or transport you to a local hospital.

####FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE####

Payment is expected at the time the service is rendered unless other arrangements have been made with me.  By agreeing to the terms of this document, you are agreeing to pay for the services rendered and any additional expenses that may be accrued in collecting said fees.  The cost of your session will be determined between you and me at the time of initial contact depending on the structure of the session and whether or not insurance is being used.  I am a preferred provider for a number of health plans. I use a Billing Specialist with whom I have a Business Associates Agreement to check your insurance benefits. The Billing Specialist makes every attempt to secure correct information from your insurance company; however, you are ultimately responsible for payment of the session if your insurance company denies payment. It is very rare that an insurance company does not cover face-to-face counseling if this benefit is part of your plan. I will authorize services if that is a necessary requirement for your insurance and will submit claims on your behalf if I am a provider of your particular insurance company. You are responsible for any deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments your insurance plan does not cover. Some insurance companies are now covering distance counseling via video sessions. My Billing Specialist will request this information at the time benefits are checked. Best efforts are made to contact your insurance company to determine your benefits and the cost to you prior to your initial session; however, there are times when this is not possible.  If you are using an insurance company for which I am not a provider, I will provide you with a superbill to submit. Payment can be made using cash, debit/credit card including HSA credit card or PayPal.  Services such as phone calls made by you to me in between sessions for consultation or therapy purposes, written reports or consultations made with your other providers for purposes of collaboration are also billable to you. Insurance companies do not pay for these services.  Fee information for these services is available upon request and necessity.  I reserve the right to change my fees with 30 days notice and to use the services of a third party collections service when necessary.  Refunds are not made after the services have been rendered.  You have the right to be informed of all fees that you are required to pay and my refund and collection policies.  Please discuss these with me if you have a concern. 

Your insurance company or managed care company may limit the number of sessions based on their assessment of medical necessity or other factors.  Their determination may or may not match what you want or need in treatment.  In the event that they will not authorize additional sessions or you exhaust the sessions that your insurance will provide, you are liable for any additional sessions provided.

Using a third party to pay for the counseling implies that some information will be released in order to obtain payment for the services.  Please see the HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES for more information.


####CONTACTING ME AND RESPONSE TIME####

In the event of an emergency, please contact 911 and/or for Georgia residents, the Georgia Crisis Line at 800-715-4225.   You may reach me at 678-720-8921, but an immediate response is not guaranteed.  A quick or immediate response in one situation does not constitute a commitment of rapid response in another situation.  I do not answer my phone during therapy sessions and will not be available to answer my phone immediately after office hours. My phone is turned off after 8:00 P.M. Eastern time.  I will make every effort to return voicemail messages within 24 business day hours unless I am on vacation at which time I will get back to you upon my return. If you contact me on the weekend, I will return your message within 72 hours unless on vacation. I do pride myself on being diligent about returning messages!  My clients are made aware of when I will be out of the office unless I have an emergency and have to leave suddenly.  Please be aware that my office phone rings directly into my cell phone, and I greatly appreciate your respectfulness in contacting me during normal business hours (9:00 a.m.- 8:00 p.m. M-F).  You have the option to contact me regarding appointment scheduling via my office line, email or texting.  I am unable per the rules of my governing boards to provide any ongoing dialogue with my clients via texting or email.  These means of communication are only for appointment scheduling.

####APPOINTMENTS####

Regular attendance at your face-to-face or distance counseling scheduled appointments is one of the keys to a successful outcome in counseling.  I reserve an hour for each appointment with a client. You are expected to be on time for your appointments. If you are late for any reason, your appointment will not be extended beyond the original scheduled time. Appointments canceled at the last minute are very detrimental to my practice.  Therefore, I ask that you notify me a minimum of one full BUSINESS day (24 hours, Monday-Friday) prior to your appointment if you need to cancel.  You will be billed for appointments you fail to cancel in accordance with this policy regardless of the reason for the cancellation.  I am bound by the rules of my governing boards to be consistent with this cancellation policy no matter the circumstance.  Currently, the fee you will be charged for a late cancellation or a no-show is $30.00.  Repeated late cancellations or missed appointments will be billed at $100.00.  Please note that these are personal financial obligations that you are responsible for and not the obligations of your insurance company.

####PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY, AND RECORDS####

Ordinarily, all communications and records created in the process of counseling are held in the strictest confidence.  However, there are exceptions to confidentiality defined in the state and federal statutes.  The most common of these exceptions is when there is a real or potential life or death emergency, when the court issues a subpoena, or when child/elder abuse or neglect is involved.  
It is also important to be aware that I use a number of electronic tools in my practice, including computers and the Internet, email, fax machines, telephones, and cell phones.  I may use these tools to store or communicate information about you and your treatment.  While reasonable backup, security, and other safeguards are in place, there is always some risk of inadvertent disclosure of information that comes with using these tools.  By signing this informed consent, you agree to accept the risk of disclosure that comes with tools that I use in my practice.

During times when I am out of town or otherwise unavailable, I may have another licensed therapist on call for me.  I reserve the right to disclose confidential information from your records and our time together, including personally identifiable information, to this on-call therapist to facilitate the coverage of your care in my absence.  I will discuss this with you in the event that this occurs.

Your records are kept electronically via a platform called TherapyNotes. I have a Business Associates Agreement with this platform. These records are password protect.

HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES, included in this packet of information, details the considerations regarding confidentiality, privacy and your records.  Periodically, the HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES may be revised and will be posted in my office or sent to you if you are receiving distance counseling.

> By accepting the terms of this agreement, you are stating that you have read the HIPPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES, and have had my questions about privacy and confidentiality answered to my satisfaction.  Further, you are stating that you understand that the HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES is incorporated by reference into this agreement.  

In the event of my death, retirement, or incapacity, the records for my clients that are actively receiving services (seen within the last month) will be given to one or more local behavioral health professionals to facilitate the continuation of treatment.  In such a situation, you have the right to continue treatment with this professional, discontinue treatment, or ask for a referral.  Your medical record will be destroyed 7 years after termination of treatment. In the event that you are a minor receiving services, your records will be destroyed when you reach the age of 25.

####PURPOSE, LIMITATIONS, AND RISKS OF TREATMENT####

Counseling, like most endeavors in the helping professions, is not an exact science.  While the ultimate purpose of counseling is to reduce your distress through a process of personal change, there are no guarantees that the treatment provided will be effective or useful.  Moreover, the process of counseling usually involves working through tough personal issues that can result in some emotional or psychological pain for the client.  Attempting to resolve issues that brought you to therapy may result in changes that were not originally intended.  Psychotherapy may result in decisions about changing behaviors, employment, substance use, schooling, relationships, or virtually any other aspect of your life.  Sometimes a decision that is positive for one family member is viewed quite negatively by another family member.  Change will sometimes be easy and swift, but more often it will be slow and sometimes frustrating.

####TREATMENT PROCESS AND RIGHTS####

Your counseling will begin with one or more sessions devoted to an initial assessment so that I can get a good understanding of the issues, your background, and any other factors that may be relevant.  When the initial assessment process is complete, we will discuss ways to treat the problem(s) that have brought you into counseling and develop a treatment plan.  You have the right and the obligation to participate in treatment decisions and in the development and periodic review and revision of your treatment plan.  You also have the right to refuse any recommended treatment or to withdraw consent to treat and to be advised of the consequences of such refusal or withdrawal.

####OUR RELATIONSHIP####

The client/therapist relationship is unique in that it is exclusively therapeutic.  In other words, it is inappropriate for a client and a therapist to spend time together socially, to bestow gifts, or to attend family or religious functions.  I am unable, per the rules of my governing boards, to connect with any of my clients via social media. The purpose of these boundaries is to ensure that you and I are clear in our roles for your treatment and that your confidentiality is maintained.

If there is ever a time when you believe that you have been treated unfairly or disrespectfully, please talk with me about it.  It is never my intention to cause this to happen to my clients, but sometimes misunderstandings can inadvertently result in hurt feelings.  I want to address any issues that might get in the way of the therapy as soon as possible.  This includes administrative or financial issues as well.  

####CONSENT FOR EVALUATION AND TREATMENT####

By agreeing to this form, consent is hereby given for evaluation and treatment under the terms described in this consent document and the HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES.  You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this informed consent agreement and the HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES.  It is agreed that either of us may discontinue the evaluation and treatment at any time and that you are free to accept or reject the treatment provided.  

In the case of a minor child, you hereby affirm that you are the custodial parent or legal guardian of the child and that you authorize services for the child under the terms of this agreement.
