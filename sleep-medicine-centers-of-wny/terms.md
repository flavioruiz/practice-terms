==================== 

####TELEMEDICINE CONSENT

I have been asked to participate in a telemedicine consultation with Dr. Daniel Rifkin. It has been explained to me that through an interactive audio and video connection, I will be able to consult with the above named provider about my medical condition. 

I understand there a possible risks of incomplete or ineffective consultations because of technology. The risks include, but may not be limited to:

- Telemedicine connection may fail to work or may be disconnected during a consult, which might result in delays of care;
- I may be required to go to the location of the consulting healthcare provider if it is felt that the information obtained via telemedicine was not sufficient to make a diagnosis and;
- In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information. 

Benefits of participating in the telemedicine consults include: 

- I will have access to a specialist without the cost, risk, and needed time for travel. 

I understand others may be present during the consultation other than the consulting provider for the purposes of assisting with the physical examination or operating the equipment and that I have a right to ask unnecessary personnel to leave. I further understand that I have a right to discontinue the consult at any time without affecting my right to future care or treatment. 

Occasionally, a consulting provider may feel that captured images or photographs would be helpful to document my medical condition. I understand that these images will be part of my medical record and will not be disclosed without my written consent. I understand that all laws protecting privacy and confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine. 

I have read this document and understand the risks and benefits of the telemedicine consultation, I have had my questions regarding the procedure explained, and I hereby consent to participate in the telemedicine visit under the conditions described in this document.

**2**. HOW SLEEP MEDICINE CENTERS OF WNY MAY USE OR DISCLOSE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)


**Uses and Disclosures Relating to Treatment, Payment or Health Care Operations.**  The following categories describe different ways that we may use or disclose your PHI.  Examples are provided where appropriate, although it is impossible to list every use and disclosure in each category.

Treatment: We will use and disclose your PHI to provide, coordinate, or manage your health care and any related services.  This includes coordination or management of your health care with another physician.  We will also disclose PHI to other physicians who may be treating you.  For example, to a physician to whom you have been referred to ensure that he/she has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you.

Payment:  We may use and disclose PHI about you so that the treatment and services you receive may be billed and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company, or a third party.  For example, we may need to disclose PHI to a health plan in order for the health plan to pay for the services rendered to you.  We may also tell your health plan about a treatment or procedures you are going to receive in order to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your health plan will cover the services.

Health Care Operations: We may use and disclose PHI about you for practice plan operations.  These uses and disclosures are necessary to run our practice plan in an efficient manner and ensure that all patients receive quality care.  For example, your medical records and PHI may be used in the evaluation of health care services, and the appropriateness and quality of health care treatment.  In addition, medical records are audited for timely documentation and correct billing.  We may also disclose PHI about you to medical students and residents for review and learning purposes.

Appointment Reminders: We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care.  For example, we may provide a written or telephone reminder that your next appointment is coming up.

To the extent we are required to disclose your PHI to contractors, agents and other business associates who need the information in order to assist us with obtaining payment or carrying out our business operations, we will have a written contract to ensure that our business associates also protect the privacy of your PHI.

**Other Uses and Disclosures that Require Your Prior Written Authorizations.**

Other uses and disclosures of your PHI will be made only with your written authorization, unless otherwise permitted or required by law as described in this NPP.

Disclosures to Family, Friends or Others (Individuals Involved in your Care or Payment of your Care):  We may release PHI about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care or the payment of your health care, unless you object in whole or part.

We may use or disclose PHI to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative or any other person that is responsible for your care of your location, general condition or death.

Required by Law: We will disclose PHI about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law and the use or disclosure complies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of such law.

For Public Health Activities: We will report information about births and deaths; to prevent or control various diseases; to report child abuse and neglect; to report reactions to medications or problems with products; to notify people of recalls of products they may be using; or to notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease.

For Health Oversight Activities:  We may disclose PHI about you to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law.

These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, eligibility or compliance, and to enforce health-related civil rights and criminal laws.

Lawsuits and Disputes:  We may disclose your PHI if we are ordered to do so by a court or administrative tribunal that is handling a lawsuit or other dispute.

This includes sharing PHI that is necessary to protect the health and safety of other inmates or persons involved in supervising or transporting inmates.

Workers’ Compensation:  We may release PHI about you for workers’ compensation or similar programs.  These programs provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.

Emergency Situations:  We may use or disclose your PHI if you need emergency treatment and we are unable to obtain your consent.  If this happens, we will try to obtain your consent as soon as we reasonably can after we treat you.

Communication Barriers:  We may use or disclose your PHI if we are unable to obtain your consent because of substantial communication barriers, and we believe you would want us to treat you if we could communicate with you.

Research:  Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes.  For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who received one medication to those who received another, for the same condition.  All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval process.  This process evaluates a proposed research project and its use of medical information, trying to balance the research needs with the patients’ need for privacy of their medical information.  Before we use or disclose medical information for research, the project will have been approved through this research approval process.  We may, however, disclose medical information about you to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to help them look for patients with specific medical needs or on decedents.  Under other limited circumstances, we will ask for your written authorization before using your PHI for research purposes.

Health–Related Benefits or Services:  We may use or disclose PHI to give you information about treatment alternatives or other health care services or benefits we offer and/or provide or that may be of interest to you. 

Fundraising:  We may use PHI to contact you in an effort raise funds for our practice plan and its operations.  We may also disclose PHI to other foundations or business associates so that these foundations or business associates may contact you in raising money for our practice plan.  We would only release contact information such as name, address and phone number and the dates you received treatment or services.  For all other fund raising activities, you have the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further fundraising communications.  To opt out, please contact the person listed in Section 4. Contact, of this NPP.

De-identified Information:  We may also disclose your PHI if it has been de-identified or if it is not possible for anyone to connect the information back to you.

Incidental Disclosure:  While we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your PHI, certain disclosures of your PHI may occur during, or as an unavoidable result of our otherwise permissible uses and disclosures of your PHI.  For example, during the course of a treatment session, other patients in the treatment area may see, or overhear discussion of, your PHI.
