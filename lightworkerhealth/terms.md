Informed Consent for Telemedicine Services
===============

Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:

- Patient medical records
- Medical images
- Live two-way audio and video
- Output data from medical devices and sound and video files

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

Expected Benefits:
- Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to initiate a visit and consult a healthcare practitioner at a distant/other sites.
- More efficient medical evaluation and management.
- Obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.

Possible Risks:
As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

- In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);
- Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment;
- In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
- In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By agreeing to this form, I understand the following:

1.  	I understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine, and that no information obtained in the use of telemedicine, which identifies me, will be disclosed to researchers or other entities without my consent.

2.  	I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment.

3. 	 I understand that I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded in the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee.

4.  	I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. My provider has explained the alternatives to my satisfaction.

5.  	I understand that telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other medical practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.

6. 	 I understand that it is my duty to inform my provider of electronic interactions regarding my care that I may have with other healthcare providers.

7. 	 I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

Patient Consent To The Use of Telemedicine
I have read and understand the information provided above regarding telemedicine, have discussed it with my physician or such assistants as may be designated, and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I hereby give my informed consent for the use of telemedicine in my medical care.

##Assignment of Benefits Agreement##

Our office will accept an assignment of benefits from your insurance company with the following provisions.  It is important to understand, though, that the contract regarding your medical benefits is between you, your employer, and your insurance company.  The obligation you have with our practice is to pay for treatment, regardless of the amount that may or may not be reimbursed by your insurance company.  The following provisions identify our policies governing insurance claims.
Although we are willing to complete insurance information forms and submit a claim on your behalf, we do not accept responsibility for the outcome of the transaction. Completing insurance forms is a courtesy we extend to you in an effort to maximize your insurance reimbursement. By having our office process your insurance forms, it is important that you understand that this does not eliminate your financial obligation for your treatment.  
We require you to sign this form and/or any other necessary assignment documents that may be required by your insurance company. This instructs your insurance company to make payment directly to our office.
We require you to pay the co-payment, which is the amount not covered by your insurance company, at the time we provide service to you.
Insurance payments ordinarily are received within 30-60 days from the time of billing. If your insurance company has not made payment to our office within 60 days, we will ask you to pay the balance due at that time. You will be responsible for seeking reimbursement from your insurance company at that time.
Our office does not guarantee that your insurance company will pay for treatment you receive from our practice. We perform routine insurance billing procedures upon verification of coverage. However, if your claim is denied, you will be responsible for paying the full amount at that time.
Our office will not enter into a dispute with your insurance company over any claim, although we will provide necessary documentation your insurance company requests to sort out any confusion or questions that may arise. We will cooperate fully with the regulations and requests of your insurance company. It is ultimately your responsibility to resolve any type of dispute over payments made or not made by your insurance company.

I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE ABOVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY CHECKING THE BOX I AUTHORIZE MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO PAY MY BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.
