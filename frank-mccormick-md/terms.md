## Consent to Communicate Online ##

*Online communication is a form of communication using “secure” Web sites or e-mail applications that apply appropriate encryption technology designed to protect the transmission of confidential information. Online communication is an **additional** option for communication along with telephone, mail, and in-person. It is not meant to replace other forms of communication with the doctor.*

By agreeing to these terms, you are agreeing that you have read and understand this treatment agreement and all of the following items:

- The details of online communication have been explained to me in terms I understand.
- Alternative methods of communication (i.e., telephone, in-person, mail) are still available to me.
- I understand that all medical communications carry some level of risk. While the likelihood of risks associated with the use of online communication in a secure environment is substantially reduced, the risks are nonetheless real and very important to understand. These risks include, but are not limited to:
 - It is easier for online communication to be forwarded, intercepted, or even changed without my knowledge.
 - Online communication is easier to falsify than handwritten or signed hard copies. Backup copies may exist on a computer or in cyberspace, even after both of us have deleted our copies.
 - I will use a secure network. I will not use standard e-mail or e-mail systems provided by employers. I understand that employers have a right to inspect and keep online communication transmitted through their system.
Online communications become part of my medical record.

- I agree to take precautions to keep online communication confidential, including but not limited to the following:
 - I will keep my password confidential.
 - I will not store messages on an employer-provided computer.
 - I will not leave messages on my screen for others to read.
 - I will review my messages before sending to make sure that they are clear and that all relevant information is included.
 - I will update my contact information as soon as it changes.
- I understand that I am responsible for taking steps to protect myself from unauthorized use of online communication. The doctor is not responsible for breaches of confidentiality caused by an independent third party or me.
- I agree to follow the procedures that the doctor implements to allow him/her to verify my identity in connection with online communication. I acknowledge that failure to comply with these procedures may terminate our online communication.
- I understand that online communication cannot be used for emergencies or time sensitive matters.
- I understand that online communication cannot be used to communicate highly sensitive medical information, such as treatment for or information related to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, or addiction treatment (alcohol, drug dependence, etc.)
- I have informed the doctor of other treatments I do not want transmitted via online communications.
- I understand that is my responsibility to determine if an unanswered online communication was received.
- I acknowledge that I have read and fully understand this consent form, including the risks associated with the online communication.
- The doctor has answered all of my questions.

**Again, please note that online communication should never be used for emergency communications or urgent requests. These should occur via telephone or by using existing emergency communications tools.**
