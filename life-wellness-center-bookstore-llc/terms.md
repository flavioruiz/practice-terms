###Routine Physical Notification###

Thank you for choosing the Life Wellness Center to perform your annual routine physical. Below are some important things for you to keep in mind in regard to how you may be billed for your visit.

Please be aware that your insurance carrier may pay all, part, or none of the cost of your services depending on your individual policy. It is the responsibility of the patient to be aware of preventive coverage limitations on his or her insurance plan prior to the visit. Charges that are not covered by the patient's insurance policy will be billed to the patient.

In some cases, it may be necessary for your provider to provide a problem-oriented service in addition to your routine physical. This portion of the visit will be subject to any co-pay, coinsurance or deductible as required by your insurance policy. Anything that you discuss with your provider that does not fall under a routine physical will be considered problem oriented. In the event that your provider discovers a problem that does not fall under a routine physical, a problem-oriented service may apply. If your 
provider suggests any additional procedures or tests in regard to the problem, these charges would also be subject to any patient responsibility as determined by your insurance plan.

I certify that I have read and fully understand the above statements and consent fully and voluntarily to its contents.
