Pain Agreement
============

The purpose of this agreement is to protect patient access to controlled substances and to protect our ability to prescribe for our patients.  
1. I'll do my part to have a full life and I know that pain medicines are not the whole answer.
2. I will try to do the things you recommend to help me manage my pain, even if they are new to me.  I will discuss any concerns I have with you.    
3. I understand that this is a trial and that you will stop the medicine if it does not help me function better.
4. I understand that this medicine will not make my pain go away and that it will probably only make it somewhat better. 
5. I understand that pain medicines can cause more harm than good, and if you decide they are no longer helping me, I will need to stop them.
6. I understand that there are a lot of possible medication side effects and have read the handout. 
7. I understand that there is a chance that I will become addicted to this medicine, even if I am taking it as you prescribe. 
8. I understand that it may not be safe for me to drive or do some work tasks. I will talk with you and my employer about this medicine if my job is safety-sensitive.
9. If I have an emergency, I will tell any other doctor caring for me about this agreement.  I will accept no more than 3 days of pain medication and tell you immediately if I receive medication from another physician.    
10. You may talk about my medical condition and medication with pharmacists and other medical providers involved in my care.
11. I will get opioid pain medication only from you, or from the doctor who covers for you when you are away.  
12. I understand that you may check for other prescriptions in the state prescription database.   
13. I will always get my pain medication prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. 
14. I understand that you won’t replace my prescription if something happens to it and that you will not give me early refills.
15. I understand that I may need to see an addiction specialist if I develop symptoms that concern you.
16. I will ask you before taking any other medicine with drowsiness listed on the label as a side effect.
17. I will not take any illegal drugs, anyone else’s prescription drugs, or use marijuana.
18. I will not drink more alcohol than you have recommended is safe for me.
19. I agree to urine or blood tests for monitoring. I understand that abnormal results may mean stopping this prescription.
20. I will take this pain medication exactly as prescribed. I will not take more than my prescribed daily dose or more often than prescribed.
21. I will swallow this pain medication whole and not break, crush, or chew or inject the medicine. I understand that changing the form of the medicine is dangerous.
22. I will not abruptly stop taking my pain medication but rather will discuss this with you if I want to stop.
23. I will keep this medicine away from children and teens.  If a child gets into this medicine, I will call 911.
24. I will not share or sell my pain medication. I will take every possible precaution to make sure no one else has access to it whether at home or work.
25. I understand that I should dispose of any leftover medicine at an official DEA drug take-back program or follow the FDA recommendations for disposal.  I have read the handout about this.
26. If I do not adhere to this agreement you, as my provider, will do one or more of the following:

 - Discharge me from your care.
 - Change my medication.
 - Change how often I see you.
 - Perform additional testing to monitor my compliance.
 - Refer me to other specialists.
 - Require assistance in the management of my medications.
