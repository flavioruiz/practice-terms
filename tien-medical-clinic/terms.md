PHYSICIAN-PATIENT ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
==================================== 
Article 1:  **Agreement to Arbitrate**: It is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice, that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by California law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as California law provides for judicial review or arbitration proceedings. Both parties to this contract, by entering into it, are giving up their constitutional rights to have any such dispute decided on a court of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of arbitration. 

Article 2: **All Claims Must be Arbitrated**: It is the intention of the parties that this agreement bind all parties whose claims may arise out of or related to treatment or service provided by the physician including any spouse or heirs of the patient and any children, whether born or unborn, at the time of the occurrence giving rise to any claim. In the case of any pregnant mother, the term “patient” herein shall mean the mother and the mother’s expected child or children. 

All claims for monetary damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court against the physician, and the physician’s partners, associates, association, corporation or partnership, and the employees, agents and estates of any if them, must be arbitrated including, without limitation, claims for loss of consortium, wrongful death, emotional distress or punitive damages. Filing of any court by the physician to collect any fee from the patient shall not waive the right to compel arbitration of any malpractice claim. 

Article 3: **Procedures and Applicable Law**: A demand for arbitration must communicate in writing to all parties. Each party shall select an arbitrator (party arbitrator) within thirty days and a third arbitrator (neutral arbitrator) shall be selected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties within thirty days of a demand for a neutral arbitrator by either party. Each party to the arbitration shall pay such party’s pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator, not including counsel fees or witness fees, or other expenses incurred by a party for such party’s own benefit. The parties agree that the arbitrators have the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of arbitrator under this contract. This immunity shall supplement, not supplant, any other applicable statutory or common law. 

Either party shall have the absolute right to arbitrate separately the issues of liability and damages upon written request to the neutral arbitrator.

The parties consent to the intervention and joinder in this arbitration of any person or entity which would otherwise be a proper additional party in a court action, and upon such intervention and joinder any existing court action against such additional person or entity shall be stayed pending arbitration. 

The parties agree that provisions of California law applicable to health care providers shall apply to disputes within this arbitration agreement, including, but not limited to, Code of Civil Procedure Section 340.5 and 667.7 and Civil Code Sections 3333.1 and 3333.2. Any party may bring before the arbitrations a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. Discovery shall be conducted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.05, however, depositions may be taken without prior approval of the neutral arbitrator. 

Article 4: **General Provisions**: All claims based upon the same incident, transaction or related circumstances shall be arbitrated in once proceeding. A claim shall be waived and forever barred if (1) on the date notice thereof is received, the claim, if asserted in a civil action, would be barred by the applicable California statute of limitations, or (2) the claimant fails to pursue the arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures prescribed herein with reasonable diligence. With respect to any matter not herein expressly provided for, the arbitrators shall be governed by the California Code of Civil Procedure provisions relating to arbitration. 

Article 5: **Revocation**: This agreement may be revoked by written notice delivered to the physician within 30 days. It is the intent of this agreement to apply to all medical services rendered any time for any condition. 

Article 6: **Retroactive Effect**: If patient intends this agreement to cover services rendered before the date agreed to (including, but not limited to, emergency treatment) patient should contact the offices of Tien Q Nguyen M.D. Inc.                                                    

Effective as of the date of first medical services.

###Informed Consent for Telemedicine Services###

Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. Providers may include primary care practitioners, specialists, and/or subspecialists. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:

- Patient medical records
- Medical images
- Live two-way audio and video
- Output data from medical devices and sound and video files

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

**Expected Benefits**:

- Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to remain in his/her ophthalmologist’s office (or at a remote site) while the physician obtains test results and consults from healthcare practitioners at distant/other sites.
- More efficient medical evaluation and management.
- Obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.

**Possible Risks**:

As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

- In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);
- Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment;
- In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
- In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By agreeing to this form, I understand the following:

1. I understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine, and that no information obtained in the use of telemedicine, which identifies me, will be disclosed to researchers or other entities without my consent.
2. I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment.
3. I understand that I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded in the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee.
4. I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. My ophthalmologist has explained the alternatives to my satisfaction.
5.  I understand that telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other medical practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.
6. I understand that it is my duty to inform my ophthalmologist of electronic interactions regarding my care that I may have with other healthcare providers.
7. I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

###Patient Consent To The Use of Telemedicine###

I have read and understand the information provided above regarding telemedicine, have discussed it with my physician or such assistants as may be designated, and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I hereby give my informed consent for the use of telemedicine in my medical care.
