###Financial Policy###
**Payment Guarantee:** For services rendered by Midwest Institute for Minimally Invasive Therapies, PC (“MIMIT”), you guarantee payment of your account at the time services are provided for any and all costs that will not are not paid by an insurance carrier, government payer (including Medicaid), and other third party payer (together, referred to as “PAYER”), including in the event that if at a later date after initial approval your Payer denies your claim. You further understand that any out-of-network charges may be your responsibility as determined by your PAYER. You acknowledge that if your dependent is provided services you will be responsible for payment under these same policies, terms, and conditions. The “Responsible Party” listed on the Patient Data Sheet will be sent the Statement and shall be responsible for paying it. If the Responsible Party is not you and that person does not pay the bill, you are responsible for satisfying the Statement.

**Assignment of Benefits:** To the extent there is third party coverage for payment of services, you agree that all medical and related benefits PAID by PAYER will be irrevocably assigned to MIMIT on your behalf.

**Billing Information:** It is essential that you provide us with complete and accurate information so that we may properly submit billing information to your insurance company (i.e. home address, phone numbers). We will make every effort to submit claims to your insurance company and promptly provide you with our statements. However, if for any reason the statement is returned to our office because of a problem with an address you provided, you may be dismissed in accordance with these policies, terms, and conditions and referred to a collection agency. To avoid this, please ensure that all of your information is accurate, current, and up-to-date. Please be sure to bring your government-issued photo identification and your insurance cards to every visit so that we may properly bill your insurance company. If you do not have your insurance card with you, you may be required to make payment in full that day.

**Medicare Agreement:** If you have Medicare coverage, you acknowledge that payment of benefits will be made to you or on your behalf for any services furnished to you by MIMIT (or the party who accepts assignment), including your physician services. You authorize any holder of medical or other information about you to release to Medicare and its agents, any information needed to determine these benefits or any benefits for related services.
Payment terms: We require payment at the time of your office visit. If you fail to make payment at the time of service we may charge an extra processing fee in recognition of the expenses of preparing and sending out a Statement. Depending on your insurance policy benefits, this payment could be for a co-payment, coinsurance, deductible, or for the entire services rendered at that visit.

**Insurance Billing:** As your healthcare provider we will file your claims with your insurance company as a courtesy after services are provided, however, if you notify us not to file it with your Payer we will honor your request. It is your responsibility to understand what services are covered under your medical insurance policy. If you have any questions whether a service will be covered we urge you to contact your insurance company before the service is provided. The codes that are listed for the services that are provided to you are based on the guidelines of the American Medical Association. There are several factors involved when making the decision for the type of services to be billed. Among those deciding factors are whether you are a new patient, the reason for the visit, the amount of time the service takes, and the complexity of the medical problem.
Insurance companies make their payment decisions about specific medical services by looking at what your insurance policy provides. ***Example: If the reason for your visit is a sports physical and your insurance company does not cover that service we cannot go back and change the reason for your visit. It is your responsibility to find this out ahead of time.***

We suggest that you contact your insurance company to find out what benefits you have under your policy before services are rendered. The customer service number is usually found on your insurance card.

Your insurance company may require a pre-certification, prior authorization, or referral for some services, such as: radiology, surgery, or specialist visits. Receiving prior authorization does not guarantee that your insurance company will pay for it. Patients have the responsibility to ensure that prior authorization is obtained prior to services rendered. You should normally receive a response from your insurance company within 30 days. This is in the form of an "Explanation of Benefits" (or "EOB"). If you do not receive it, we would appreciate you contacting your insurance company to check the status of your claim in order to expedite payment. Please call our Billing Department if you encounter any difficulty with your insurance company and we will try to assist you. You are responsible for payment until the account is paid in full by your insurance company. Once we have received an EOB from your insurance company indicating the amount you will be responsible for, a Statement for the balance will be sent to you and payment is expected by the due date contained on our statements.

**Interest and Attorney's Fees:** In the event that amounts due on account of services provided to you are not satisfied when due, MIMIT shall be entitled to charge interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per annum) and you shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in efforts to collect any unpaid amounts due from you, including any interest charges due, court costs, and all reasonable attorney's fees. Further, in the event that a check is returned for insufficient funds, all charges incurred by MIMIT shall be your responsibility.

**Note to divorced parents of dependents:** The Statement for your dependent will be sent to you and you are expected to pay it promptly. Even if you do not believe you are the “responsible party” we expect you to make payment, and then you can take action on your own to recoup from the party you believe responsible.

**Workers Compensation Injury:** If you believe you are being seen for an injury/illness as a result of your job, we must have written authorization from your employer to confirm this, and directions from your employer regarding who we should bill for this service. If we do not have this information at the time services are provided, we will bill you and/or your insurance company.

**Self Pay Services:** Are services that are not covered by an insurance policy or third party payer. Self Pay patients will receive a 15% discount across the board for professional services rendered, when payment is made in full at the time services are rendered (and where no claim form is prepared or billing statement has to be mailed).

**Payment is your responsibility:** Our relationship is with you, to provide quality healthcare to you and/or your dependent. Consequently, all charges incurred are your responsibility. The obligation to ensure payment in a timely manner lies with you. Unfortunately, we cannot always depend on your insurance company to make timely payment on your behalf. We are not responsible for delays, misplaced claims, or the need for additional information from you by your insurance company. 

**Payment Options:** If you are unable to meet your financial obligation, payment arrangements can be made. Financing options may be available. Contact our Billing Department to discuss payment options, before your account becomes over due.

**Making Payments:** Patients may pay by cash, money order, check or personal credit card, which can include credit cards to pay from your “flexible spending account” and/or “health savings account,” if you have these. One, or all, of these cards may be used to pay your bill, and may be kept on file by us to facilitate billing. Patients agree if they have a credit balance after paying for a service, MIMIT can apply it to any outstanding balances on their account.

**Fees Assessed by MIMIT:** You may be charged fees for the following: **(1) Returned Checks (2) Completion of Forms** (e.g. Disability or Family Medical Leave) **(3) Copying of Medical Records (4) Failure to Cancel Appointment (“No Show”)** - if you do not advise us of your inability to keep your appointment prior to 24 hours before your appointment. The Fee for a No Show appointment may be assessed up to the amount in our current Fee Schedule.

**Termination of Services:** If you do not respond to 3 notices to the address we have on file, you agree that MIMIT may terminate your relationship with all of its offices. You will be considered an active patient as long as your account is in good standing and we provide you services within a 3 year period. You will have deemed yourself as terminating our relationship if you have no contact with us for this period of time. Acceptance back into the practice as a new patient is at the discretion of the individual provider/location.

**Authorization to Release of Medical Information:** You authorize the release of information by MIMIT to third party payers, health care institutions, physicians and other providers involved in your medical care. You agree that as necessary for your care, MIMIT may share information with family members and friends as minimally necessary to make decisions about your care. You agree that MIMIT may provide your medical records to third-party payers, insurance companies, review agencies, employers, welfare departments, and to third-party data service providers, including Health Information Exchanges, like the Illinois Health Information Exchange (ILHIE). This may include records about infectious diseases and drug and alcohol abuse treatment.

**Accidents and Motor Vehicle Injuries:** Each individual location can decide whether or not to work with you through a third party payer to cover services rendered. In all cases you bear the responsibility for these costs and must pay them promptly at any time that location decides to bill you directly.

**Continuing Agreement:** I have read this information carefully and agree that everything in this Agreement applies to current and future health care services provided by MIMIT. I acknowledge that MIMIT may change these terms without notice to me.

##Informed Consent for Telemedicine Services##
Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. Providers may include primary care practitioners, specialists, and/or subspecialists. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:

- Patient medical records
- Medical images
- Live two-way audio and video
- Output data from medical devices and sound and video files

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to remain in his/her ophthalmologist’s office (or at a remote site) while the physician obtains test results and consults from healthcare practitioners at distant/other sites.
- More efficient medical evaluation and management.
- Obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.

**Possible Risks:**
As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

- In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);
- Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment;
- In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
- In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By agreeing to this form, I understand the following:
1. I understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine, and that no information obtained in the use of telemedicine, which identifies me, will be disclosed to researchers or other entities without my consent.
2. I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment.
3. I understand that I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded in the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee.
4. I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. My ophthalmologist has explained the alternatives to my satisfaction.
5. I understand that telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other medical practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.
6. I understand that it is my duty to inform my ophthalmologist of electronic interactions regarding my care that I may have with other healthcare providers.
7. I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

###Patient Consent To The Use of Telemedicine###
I have read and understand the information provided above regarding telemedicine, have discussed it with my physician or such assistants as may be designated, and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I hereby give my informed consent for the use of telemedicine in my medical care.
