Informed Consent for Telemedicine Services
=============

Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:

 - Patient medical records
 - Medical images
 - Live two-way audio and video
 - Output data from medical devices and sound and video files

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

**Expected Benefits:**

 - Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to remain in his/her physician’s office (or at a remote site) while the physician obtains test results and consults from healthcare practitioners at distant/other sites.
 - More efficient medical evaluation and management.
 - Obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.

**Possible Risks:**
As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

 - In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);
 - Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment;
 - In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
 - In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By agreeing to this form, I understand the following:

1. I understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine, and that no information obtained in the use of telemedicine, which identifies me, will be disclosed to researchers or other entities without my consent.

2. I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment.

3. I understand that I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded in the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee.

4. I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. My doctor has explained the alternatives to my satisfaction.

5. I understand that telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other medical practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.

6. I understand that it is my duty to inform my doctor of electronic interactions regarding my care that I may have with other healthcare providers.

7. I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

Proposition 215 Medical Agreements:

**CONTRADICTIONS, SIDE EFFECTS AND LIABILITY RELEASE**

Medication allowed under Proposition 215 may affect or impair; my coordination and
cognition, my ability to drive, operate heavy machinery or ability to engage in
potentially hazardous activities.

Vaporizers may substantially reduce many of the potentially harmful smoke toxins that
are normally present in smoke, because although smoking medication under proposition
215 has not been linked to lung cancer, smoking it can cause respiratory harm such as
bronchitis.

Many researchers agree that such smoke contains known carcinogens (Chemicals that
can cause cancer), and that smoking such medication may increase the risk of
respiratory diseases and cancers of the lungs, mouth, and tongue. Such smoke contains
chemicals known as tars that may be harmful to my health.

I understand that side effects, while rare, may occur while I am taking such medication.
These side effects have been explained to me.

Side effects of medication under proposition 215 can include, but are not limited to:

Anxiety, Inability to concentrate, Difficulty in completing complex tasks, Sedation,
Alterations in the perception of time and space, Impairment of motor skills, reaction
time and physical coordination, Low blood pressure, Dizziness, Increased talkativeness,
Impairment of short-term memory, Confusion, Euphoria, Tachycardia (fast heart beat),
and heart palpitations, Paranoia, Suppression of the body’s immune system, Psychotic
symptoms (i.e. delusions, hallucinations)
The potency and effects of medication varies. Estimating the proper dosage is very
important. Symptoms of withdrawal, while generally mild, can include:
Nausea, Vomiting, Disturbances to heart rhythms and numbness in the limbs, Hacking
cough.
For some patients, chronic use can lead to laryngitis, bronchitis, and general apathy. I
understand that some patients can become dependent on such medication and could
experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop. 

Symptoms of withdrawal, while
generally mild, can include:
- Feelings of depression, sadness or irritability

- Insomnia
- Sleep disturbances
- Unusual tiredness
- Trouble concentrating
- Loss of appetite

I understand that the medical plant covered under proposition 215 is not a food crop
and therefore not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and may contain
unknown quantities of impurities, active ingredients and/or contaminants. While under
the influence of such medication, the use of alcohol is not recommended. The possibility
exists that such medication may exacerbate schizophrenia in persons predisposed to
that disorder, although such medication does not produce any known psychosis.
In addition, the undersigned, my heirs, assigns or anyone acting on my behalf, hold the physician and his principals, agents and lease managers, free and harmless from any and all responsibility for any and all unforeseen harm resulting to me and/or any other individuals as a result of my use of my compassionate use recommendation.
The Steady Care Medical – Online Medical Card staff physician has explained to the patient, the nature and purpose of alternative herbal medication allowed under Proposition 215 SB 420 treatment including its benefits and possible side effects and have asked the patient if he/she has any questions regarding his/her treatment with
such medication and answered those questions to the best of our ability.
