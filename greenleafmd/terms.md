Informed Consent for Telemedicine Services
=============

Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:

 - Patient medical records
 - Medical images
 - Live two-way audio and video
 - Output data from medical devices and sound and video files

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

**Expected Benefits:**

 - Improved access to medical care by enabling a patient to remain in his/her physician’s office (or at a remote site) while the physician obtains test results and consults from healthcare practitioners at distant/other sites.
 - More efficient medical evaluation and management.
 - Obtaining expertise of a distant specialist.

**Possible Risks:**
As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

 - In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);
 - Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment;
 - In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
 - In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By agreeing to this form, I understand the following:

1. I understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine, and that no information obtained in the use of telemedicine, which identifies me, will be disclosed to researchers or other entities without my consent.

2. I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment.

3. I understand that I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded in the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee.

4. I understand that a variety of alternative methods of medical care may be available to me, and that I may choose one or more of these at any time. My doctor has explained the alternatives to my satisfaction.

5. I understand that telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other medical practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.

6. I understand that it is my duty to inform my doctor of electronic interactions regarding my care that I may have with other healthcare providers.

7. I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

**Release of Liability**

I understand that I must be a California Resident to obtain an approval or recommendation for the use of cannabis (medical marijuana) under California’s Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (Health and Safety Code #11362.5)

I affirm that I have a serious medical condition that adversely affects my quality of life. I have found or am interested in finding whether cannabis provides substantial relief and improvement in my condition.

I understand that the cannabis plant is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and therefore may contain unknown quantities of active ingredients, impurities and/or contaminates. In requesting an approval or recommendation for the use of this plant as medication I assume full responsibility for any and all risk of this action.

I am advised that the cannabis smoke contains chemicals known as tars that may be harmful to my health. Recent research indicated that vaporizing cannabis might eliminate exposure to tar. Should respiratory problems or other ill effects be experienced in association with its use, it should be discontinued and reported to a physician.

I am advised that the use of cannabis may affect my coordination and cognition in ways that could impair my ability to drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in potentially hazardous activities. I assume full responsibility for any harm resulting to me and/or other individuals as a result of my use of cannabis.

California’s Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (Health and Safety Code #11362.5) provides for the possession and cultivation of cannabis for the personal medical purposes of a patient with a physician approval or recommendation. It should be made absolutely clear that the physician, staff, management and representatives of this practice are neither providing cannabis, nor are they encouraging any illegal activity in my obtaining cannabis.

I hereby request a consultation by a physician for purposes of determining the appropriateness of medical cannabis treatment. There are no claims about the medical efficacy of cannabis. The physician, staff, management and representatives of this practice are addressing specific aspects of my medical care and, unless otherwise stated, are in no way establishing themselves as my primary care provider. Should an approval be made for my medical use of cannabis, I understand that there is an expiration of this approval at a date specified by the physician. I understand that it is my responsibility to see a physician to assess the possible continuance of cannabis use beyond the approval expiration date. Furthermore, I, my heirs, or anyone acting on my behalf, hold the physician and his/her principals, agents, employees and management, harmless and free from any liability resulting from the use of cannabis.

If anything changes with my medical condition I will notify GreenLeaf Care immediately.

I understand that GLC may be contacted to verify the information contained in my physician’s letter of recommendation. I hereby authorize the staff of GLC to discuss my medical condition and the contents of my physician’s letter of recommendation for verification purposes.

I acknowledge and testify under penalty of perjury under California law, that I am not working, nor have I ever worked for a federal law enforcement agency (e.g., the DEA, FBI, CIA, FDA, or AFT).

I state as fact that I am not an undercover officer representing any of the aforementioned agencies. I testify as fact that I am not here to entrap or gather evidence for a local, state, or federal agency. I do not work for, nor represent in any way, any local, state, or federal law enforcement agency.

The purpose of my visit is to obtain a personal and private consultation and evaluation of medicinal cannabis that I feel may benefit my medical condition. If I am approved to use medical cannabis, I swear I will not cultivate or distribute medicinal marijuana outside the confines of the law.

I certify that I have read this document and understand its declarations.
